## AlgoCompSynth
"AlgoCompSynth" is a word I made up to describe what it is that I want to do.
It's a compression of "algorithmic composition and digital sound synthesis."
That's a pretty broad class of music; to narrow it down, the following are my
main inspirations.

- Iannis Xenakis' _Formalized Music_ [@xenakis1992formalized]. Xenakis took the
applied mathematics of his day, for example, operations research and game
theory, and used these algorithms to create scores for conventional and
electronic performers. He also invented a technique called "Dynamic
Stochastic Synthesis", which uses Markov processes to specify not just the
score of a piece but the parameters of the sound waveforms
[@hoffmann1996implementing; @brown2005extending; @xenakis1992formalized].

- Alternate tunings. Primary among these is William Sethares' _Tuning, Timbre
Spectrum, Scale_ [@sethares1998tuning; @sethares2013tuning]. Also influential:
Wendy Carlos [@carlos1987tuning], Harry Partch [@partch1979genesis], Erv
Wilson [@narushima2019microtonality] and Nick Collins [@collins2008errant;
@collins2012even].

- Physical modeling synthesis. A comprehensive reference can be found at
[@paspweb2010].

- Spectral music. This is another advanced synthesis methodology; a recent
reference is [@lazzarini2021spectral]

My current home for published music is on Bandcamp at
<https://algocompsynth.bandcamp.com/>. I may move to Gumroad, which allows
publishing a broader range of digital media artefacts than music and music
videos.

## Other AlgoCompSynth projects

1. [AlgoCompSynth-One](https://github.com/AlgoCompSynth/AlgoCompSynth-One):
This is a platform for doing high-performance digital signal processing and
musical AI on NVIDIA GPUs. I currently support Windows 11 WSL Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
and NVIDIA Jetson JetPack 5.

    If I can make everything work I will be supporting native Windows 11.
    `AlgoCompSynth-One` is based on
    [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html),
    and Mamba runs on Windows, so unless other dependencies can't be found, it
    should be possible.

2. [eikosany](https://algocompsynth.github.io/eikosany/): This is an R
package for algorithmic composition with musical scales derived by Erv Wilson
and students of his theories.

3. [consonaR](https://algocompsynth.github.io/consonaR/): This is an R
package to perform the computations described in _Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum,
Scale_ [@sethares2013tuning]. This is a superset of any such algorithms that
will be deployed in CLAMS; only calculations that need to be performed
during a performance need to be deployed in CLAMS.

There is a fairly large overlap in functionality between `eikosany` and
`consonaR`. There's a plan for refactoring the two, but that work is on hold
until I get more of `CLAMS` done.
