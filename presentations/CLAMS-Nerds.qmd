# The Prime Directives

## Forth 2012 compatibility?
- Extended subject of Forth 2012 [@forth2022] standard
- Not all CORE words implemented
- Some non-standard word sets implemented
- But ... 
    * CLAMS-Forth words ***in*** Forth 2012 work the same way.

## Run on a Raspberry Pi Pico WH
- Documentation: [@raspberrypi2023b]
- RP2040 CPU: Dual-core Arm Cortex M0+ with 264 KiB of SRAM
- Co-processors for division and digital signal processing
- I/O state machine (PIO) and ***oodles*** of real-world connectivity
- 2 MiB of flash
- 2.4 GHz WiFi / Bluetooth
- $7US with debug connector / headers for breadboarding

## Build with Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK

- Documentation:  [@raspberrypi2023a]

## Premature optimizations
- Dictionary split between RAM and flash
- Subroutine threading
- Inline coding / assembly
- Top of stack in register
- Engine in assembly
