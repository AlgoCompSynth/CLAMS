# Me and Forth

## Me - retired scientific applications programmer
- I got paid to write
    - Assembly
    - Fortran
    - Awk / sed / grep / *nix shell
    - Perl
    - R

## I learned for hobby projects
- Lisp
- Forth
- Ruby
  
## I never learned
- COBOL
- APL
- SNOBOL4
- Algol / Pascal / C / C++ / Java / C# / Objective C / D / Rust / Go
- PHP
- Python
- JavaScript

## Forth
- 1980s 
    - learned Forth via HESForth on Commodore 64
- mid-late 1990s
    - primary Forth engine was HP100LX Palmtop PC
        - 16-bit 80186
    - wrote some articles for FORTH Dimensions
    - wrote some trading system software
    - used mostly hforth and Tom Almy's Forth compiler

## Why I stopped writing Forth
- by 1999 I had faster machines that ran my hobby code in Perl
- I wasn't using it at work
- I was learning Linux and R at work
- Too much mental context switching kills productivity!

# (Two sunspot cycles pass ...)

# He's baaack! And he brought ... CLAMS!

## CLAMS goal
- algorithmic music composition and performance ...
- live ...
- in real time ...
- on a Raspberry Pi Pico!

## Software Inspirations - Forth
- Hierarchical Music Specification Language (HMSL)
    - long history and experience with experimental composers
    - currently being actively enhanced!
    - <https://github.com/philburk/hmsl.git>
- FORMULA - FORth MUsic LAnguage
    - designed for improvisation in real time
    - contained a real-time operating system
    - @andersonkiuvila1989, @andersonkiuvila1991
    - Python successor: Numula <https://github.com/davidpanderson/Numula/wiki>

## Software Inspirations - Live coding
- _Live Coding: A User's Manual_ [@blackwell2022live]
- The TOPLAP Manifesto
    - "Show Us Your Screens"
    - <https://toplap.org/wiki/ManifestoDraft>
- GitHub Awesome Live Coding
    - <https://github.com/toplap/awesome-livecoding>

## Musical inspirations
- Iannis Xenakis [@xenakis1992formalized, especially chapter XIII, "Dynamic
Stochastic Synthesis"]
- Andrew R. Brown â€œGendynish: Stochastic Synthesis on the Arduino"
[@brown2019gendynish]
- Nick Collins
    - "Errant Sound Synthesis" [@collins2008errant]
    - "Even More Errant Sound Synthesis" [@collins2012even]

## CLAMS architecture
- a domain-specific language implemented in Forth
- conceptually, ChucK (<https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/>),
[@salazar2014programming] semantics with Forth syntax
    - low-level words: digital synthesis and microcontroller audio
    - mid-level words: construct signal flow graph
    - high-level words: provide live performance interface

# Forth base: zeptoforth

## Highly optimized!
- subroutine-threaded
- allows inline expansion of words
- many primitives in assembly

## Close to the metal
- words for nearly all the RP2040 hardware
- has an RP2040 assembler
- can compile to RAM or flash
- real-time operating system capabilites

# Road map

## Proof of concept (v0.2.5) - Software
- direct digital synthesis / sine  wave of any frequency
- maybe two oscillators and frequency modulation
- maybe "triangle" / "sawtooth" / "pulse" waves
- maybe a filter and envelope generator and low-frequency oscillator
- target date: 2023-03-17

## Proof of concept (v0.2.5) - Hardware
- Pimoroni Pico Audio Pack
    - ships from the UK
    - one in hand
    - <https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-audio-pack>

## First release (v0.5.0) - Software
- will re-scope project after proof of concept!
    - need to assess audio performance constraints
- all synthesis / audio I/O words
- goal is all synthesis algorithms in Csound 7
    - <https://flossmanual.csound.com/>
- target date: 2023-05-12

## First release (v0.5.0) - Hardware
- Waveshare Audio Expansion Module for Raspberry Pi Pico
    - ships from China
    - on order
    - <https://www.waveshare.com/pico-audio.htm>

## Second release (v0.7.5)
- signal flow graph interpreter
- target date: 2023-06-16

## Full release (v0.9.0+)
- live performance user interface
- possibly port to other audio microcontrollers
- target date: 2023-07-14
