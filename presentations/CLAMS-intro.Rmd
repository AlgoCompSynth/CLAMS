# Me and Forth {.bigger}

## Me - retired scientific applications programmer
- Got paid to write
    - Assembly
    - Fortran
    - Awk / sed / grep / *nix shell
    - Perl
    - R

## Me - learned for hobby projects
- Lisp
- Forth
- Ruby
  
## Me - never learned
- APL
- C/C++ / Java / C# / Objective C / D / Rust / Go
- PHP
- Python
- JavaScript

## Forth - mid to late 1990s
- Learned Forth via HESForth on Commodore 64 late 1980s
- Primary Forth engine was HP100LX Palmtop PC
- Wrote some articles for FORTH Dimensions
- Wrote some trading system software in Forth
- Used mostly hforth and Tom Almy's Forth compiler
- Later ran the Forth that came with Jack Woehr's _Forth: The New Model_
    - Google is drawing a blank on which Forth that was

## When and why I stopped writing Forth
- late 1990s - early 2000s
- I wasn't using it at work
- I owned faster computers that ran my hobby programs in Perl
- I was learning Linux and R at work

# He's baaack! And he brought ... CLAMS! {.bigger}

## CLAMS goal
- Algorithmic music composition and performance ...
- live ...
- in real time ...
- on a Raspberry Pi Pico!

## Inspirations
- Hierarchical Music Specification Language (HMSL)
    - Lengthy history and experience with experimental composers
    - Currently being actively enhanced!
    - <https://github.com/philburk/hmsl.git>
- FORMULA - FORth MUsic LAnguage
    - Designed for improvisation in real time
    - Contained a real-time operating system
    - @andersonkiuvila1989, @andersonkiuvila1991
- Live Coding: A User's Manual [@blackwell2022live]

## CLAMS architecture
- A domain-specific language implemented in Forth
- Conceptually, ChucK (<https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/>), [@salazar2014programming] semantics with Forth syntax
    - Low-level words: digital synthesis and microcontroller audio
    - Mid-level words: construct signal flow graph
    - High-level words: provide performance interface

# Forth base: zeptoforth {.bigger}

## Highly optimized!
- Subroutine-threaded
- Allows inline expansion of words
- Many primitives in assembly

## Close to the metal
- Word sets for nearly all the RP2040 hardware
- Has an RP2040 assembler
- Can compile to RAM or flash
- real-time operating system capabilites

# Road map {.bigger}

## Initial hardware: Pimoroni Pico Audio Pack
- <https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-audio-pack>

## Proof of concept (v0.2.5)
- sine / triangle / sawtooth / pulse wave of any frequency
- maybe a filter and envelope generator and low-frequency oscillator
- early to mid March

## First release (v0.5.0)
- all synthesis / audio I/O words
- goal is everything you can do in Csound 7
    - <https://flossmanual.csound.com/>
- late March / early April

## Second release (v0.7.5)
- signal flow graph
- possibly other RP2040-based hardware
- late April / early May

## Full release (v1.0.0)
- live performance user interface
- possibly other microcontroller audio hardware
- optimistically, late July
- realistically, September
    - I want something other people can use at this point!
