# A (Welcome) Surprise in the (E)mail

## August 8, 2024 - the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 is announced

- [Raspberry Pi Pico 2, our new $5 microcontroller board, on sale now](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-2-our-new-5-microcontroller-board-on-sale-now/)
- [Our RP2350 Partners made all this excellent stuff for you](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/our-rp2350-partners-made-all-this-excellent-stuff-for-you/)
- [Whatâ€™s new in Raspberry Pi Pico 2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/whats-new-in-pico-2/)
- [RP2350: the brains of Raspberry Pi Pico 2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/rp2350-the-brains-of-raspberry-pi-pico-2/)

## Pico vs. Pico 2

## RP2040 vs. RP2350

## So I bought a few partner boards

- [Pimoroni Pico Plus 2](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-plus-2-w?variant=42182811942995)
- [SparkFun Pro Micro - RP2350](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/24870)
- [iLabs Challenger+ RP2350 BConnect](https://ilabs.se/challenger-rp2350-bconnect-datasheet/)
- [iLabs Challenger+ RP2350 WiFi6/BLE5](https://ilabs.se/challenger-rp2350-wifi-ble/)

# The CLAMS Development Environment

## A collection of command-line Linux tools

- [Raspberry Pi Pico-series C/C++ SDK](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf)
- [Raspberry Pi Pico Python SDK](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf)
- [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/)
- [Arduino-Pico](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [PlatformIO Core (CLI)](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/index.html)
- Coming soon! [Zephyr](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/index.html)

## A container to run them in!

- Many third parties have limited testing resources
- If they support Linux at all, it's RHEL (expensive), or
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS aka "Jammy Jellyfish"
- So I built a [Distrobox](https://distrobox.it/) container running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Hosted on [Universal Blue Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/)
- (But any Distrobox host will work - any recent Linux distro)

# C Forth

## Why C Forth?

- Optimized for microcontrollers
- Comprehensive - derived from Mitch Bradley's Open FirmWare
- Extensible in either C or Forth!
- Portable - I want to run Forth on other microcontrollers
- Linux build process is straightforward using PlatformIO
