# Previously on CLAMS

## The original concept - early 2022
- Forth for the Electro-Smith Daisy Seed [@electrosmith2024]
    - Microcontroller board designed for digital music
    - ARM Cortex-M7 MCU, running at 480MHz
    - Hardware floating point and DSP instructions
    - 64MB of SDRAM for up to 10 minute long audio buffers
    - 8MB external flash
    - Stereo audio IO - 96kHz / 24-bit audio hardware
    - No WiFi or Bluetooth
    - $29.95US quantity one
    - Available in various packaged modules
    - Control logic and synthesis both done in Forth

## Revised concept - early 2023
- Forth for the Raspberry Pi Pico (WH)
    - Microcontroller board designed for general applications
    - Dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+, running at 133 Mhz
    - Co-processor for division, interpolation and I/O
    - No floating point or DSP instructions
    - 262KB RAM
    - 2 MB flash
    - No SD card
    - No audio hardware
    - 2.4 GHz WiFi and Bluetooth
    - $7.00 US
    - Audio expansion packs available
    - Control logic and synthesis both done in Forth
    
## Stepping up a level - what does a digital synthesizer need?
    - A way of reliably generating accurately-timed pulse-code modulated samples
    - A way of converting those samples to analog voltages for recording or performance
    - An interface for the composer / performer

## So what was wrong with the previous two concepts?
1. Portability - Forth needs to be hand-ported to individual MCUs.
    - Other desirable boards: Teensy 4.1 and ESP32-S3, C3 and C6
2. Only I2S audio was realistically supportable
    - USB audio and Bluetooth audio cannot be realistically done in Forth

# CLAMS - the New Design

## Arduino for portability
- All target boards (Daisy, Teensy, ESP32 and Pico / Pico 2) have Arduino support
- I2S audio is supported on all test boards
- Bluetooth audio is supported if the board has the hardware
- USB audio is in alpha testing

## C3 Forth for Arduino [@c3forth2024]
- Token-threaded Forth written in C/C++
- Runs on Linux (native), Raspberry Pi Pico and Teensy 4.1 (Arduino)
- Under active development
- Well-documented

## CLAMS architecture
- a domain-specific language implemented in Forth
- conceptually, ChucK (<https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu>),
[@salazar2014programming] semantics with Forth syntax
    - low-level words: digital synthesis and microcontroller audio
    - mid-level words: construct signal flow graph
    - high-level words: algorithmic composition and live performance

# Forth base: C3

# Road map

## Target audio hardware
- Pimoroni Pico Audio Pack
    - ~ $16US plus shipping
    - requires an expander board for UART connection (~ $9US)
- Waveshare Pico Audio Expansion Module 
    - ~ $20US plus shipping
    - includes speakers
- Waveshare Overall Evaluation Board
    - ~ $50US plus shipping
    - includes 3.5 inch resistive touch screen
    - includes serial-to-USB adapter
    - includes microSD card adapter
