## AlgoCompSynth
"AlgoCompSynth" is a word I made up to describe what it is that I want to do.
It's a compression of "algorithmic composition and digital sound synthesis."
That's a pretty broad class of music; to narrow it down, the following are my
main inspirations.

- Iannis Xenakis' _Formalized Music_ [@xenakis1992formalized]. Xenakis took the
applied mathematics of his day, for example, operations research and game
theory, and used these algorithms to create scores for conventional and
electronic performers.
- Alternate tunings. Primary among these is William Sethares' _Tuning, Timbre
Spectrum, Scale_ [@sethares1998tuning; @sethares2013tuning]. Also influential:
Wendy Carlos [@carlos1987tuning], Harry Partch [@partch1979genesis], Erv
Wilson [@narushima2019microtonality] and Nick Collins [@collins2008errant;
@collins2012even].
- Physical modeling synthesis. A comprehensive reference can be found at
[@PASPWEB2010].
