Contributing to the project is really quite simple:

1. Read the code of conduct at <https://github.com/AlgoCompSynth/CLAMS/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>.
2. Everything starts with an issue. See [Always start with an issue](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/03/03/start-with-an-issue/) for the philosophy.
    * Is the documentation unclear? [File an issue](https://github.com/AlgoCompSynth/CLAMS/issues/new).
    * Did you find a bug? [File an issue](https://github.com/AlgoCompSynth/CLAMS/issues/new).
    * Do you want to request a feature? [File an issue](https://github.com/AlgoCompSynth/CLAMS/issues/new).

*Please, don't go through the mechanics of forking / pull requests even for trivial typo changes without filing an issue. [File an issue](https://github.com/AlgoCompSynth/CLAMS/issues/new).*
