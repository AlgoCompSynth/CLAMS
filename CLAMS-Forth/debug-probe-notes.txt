1. The Raspberry Pi Pico shows up as a USB serial device `/dev/ttyACMx`. The
Raspberry Pi Debug Probe also shows up as a USB serial device `/dev/ttyACMy`.

2. The adapters are recognized in random order, so if you want to set them to
specific values, power them on after the host is booted in the order you want.

3. Example: I want the Pico on /dev/ttyACM0 and the debug probe on /dev/ttyACM1.
So I power the Pico up first after boot and the debug probe second.
