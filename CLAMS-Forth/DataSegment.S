@ We put all of the data space into a single file, so we can manage it at assembly
@ time and know how much space it takes up. Unlike many Forths, CLAMS has ***no***
@ transient areas - all flash and RAM areas are allocated ahead of time with global
@ names the linker knows about. The only variable-sized data structure in CLAMS is
@ the data space portion of the dictionary - the part created by the user at run
@ time. And it has a pre-defined maximum size.

@ Stack logic:

@ The CLAMS-Forth parameter stack grows from high addresses downwards. Register
@ `PSTOP` holds the top cell of the stack. The rest of the stack is in RAM, and
@ register `PT2ND` points to the second cell of the stack. CLAMS-Forth uses the
@ system stack for the return stack, so it uses PUSH and POP via the SP register.
